# University of North Florida
# CAP 6100 - User Experience Design

This project contains the prototype page developed for the Jacksonville Public Library system.

## Technologies
This project is developed using JavaScript and React.js. PrimeReact is used as the component library. Components such as containers are given the data using props and global state logic is handled by using Context API.

## Functionality and Limitations
The project contains only the React pages of the library system. No actual logic is implemented in most scenarios. Only the click through functionality is added for navigation.

## Running the prototype
To install the dependencies, npm install command can be used after extractions. After the packages are installed, the program can be started with npm start and the pages are going to be accessible via [localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) through a web browser.
